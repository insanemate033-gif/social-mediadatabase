### Social Media Database Project

## About‚ùì

* Through this project we are creating a basic structure of social media database which could easily be connected to frontend interface.
Here we are managing the data of multiple users, their followers , interests and public activity on the social media platform which includes postlikes ,comments , commentlikes , hashtag followed ,bookmarks and many more...
Through our SQL query we have shown a clear cut description of connection and inter relation between different activities on social media.
Here we have tried to fetch and store the data in its true storage form into this database like (img/videos in url)
With our true efforts and research we have tried to give a simple and more exact view of a basic social interconnecting site.
