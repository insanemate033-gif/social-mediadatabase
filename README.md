#### Social Media Database Project

### About❓

* Through this project we are creating a basic structure of social media database which could easily be connected to frontend interface.
* Here we are managing the data of multiple users, their followers , interests and public activity on the social media platform which includes postlikes 
 ,comments , commentlikes , hashtag followed ,bookmarks and many more...
* Through our SQL query we have shown a clear cut description of connection and inter relation between different activities on social media.
* Here we have tried to fetch and store the data in its true storage form into this database like (img/videos in url)
* With our true efforts and research we have tried to give a simple and more exact view of a basic social interconnecting site.
